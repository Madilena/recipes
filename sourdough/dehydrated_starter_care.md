# dehydrated starter care

My recommendations below come from [The Perfect Loaf](https://www.theperfectloaf.com/store-sourdough-starter/)

## reactivating a dried crumble starter

1. Place dried crumble starter in a large jar (something that can hold about 3 cups or about 600 ml)

2. Add 50 grams of flour (half bread flour & half whole wheat flour)

3. Add enough water to make the starter mixture easy to stir

4. Place a tea towel or cover over jar. Place jar in a cool,dry place away from sunlight and heat sources (eg oven, stove, toaster, microwave)

5. Make a note of where the starter's starting volume is

6. Wait about 12-24 hours until the next feeding (see starter_maintenance.md for feeding advice). During this time, observe the starter's health - you want to see bubbles and a rise in volume. Once the starter has at least doubled in volume, you can feed it again
