# starter maintenance

sourdough starters need to be fed with flour and water on a regular schedule when not in the fridge

I feed my starter with a 50/50 mix of whole wheat flour and bread flour. [Here's an article](https://www.seriouseats.com/the-best-flour-for-sourdough-starters-an-investigation) on different flours to feed your starter.

store starter in a jar with a wide lid, without ridges/contours (Weck is great). write jar mass on bottom

change starter jars about every 2 weeks to prevent mold. I actually have 2 jars that I use and toggle back and forth with each feeding so that I use a new, clean jar each time I feed the starter

sourdough feedings are given as a ratio of starter:flour:water

These days I've been feeding my starter at a ratio of 1:5:5

## sourdough feeding example

For this example, we'll have a feeding ratio of 1:2:2

25g of starter, 50g of flour, 50g of water (room temp or cold)

1. put starter in a sanitized jar
2. add water to starter first, mix, then add flour and mix
3. place a kitchen towel over jar
4. when the starter has doubled or tripled in size, it is at its peak
5. another indicator that the starter is at peak, is when the top gets bubbly/bumpy

for the next feeding, we now have a starting mass of 125g of starer (25g of starter, 50g of flour, 50g of water)

6. remove 100g (this is your discard and can be saved in fridge to make other baked goods)
7. now we are back to 25g of starter. add 50g of flour and 50g of water
8. clean the lip of the jar to prevent mold and place kitchen towel over jar
9. continue this every day. if you forget a day, it's not a big deal, just keep going
10. if storing starter in fridge, feed 1:5:4, put on a loose lid, let rest for an hour, then refrigerate
11. if reactivating a refrigerated starter, let it sit out at room temp for an hour, feed at normal ratio of 2-3 feedings before using to bake bread
