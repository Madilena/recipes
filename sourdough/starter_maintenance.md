# starter maintenance

sourdough starters need to be fed with flour and water on a regular schedule when not in the fridge

I feed my starter with a 50/50 mix of whole wheat flour and bread flour. [Here's an article](https://www.seriouseats.com/the-best-flour-for-sourdough-starters-an-investigation) on different flours to feed your starter.

store starter in a jar with a wide lid, without ridges/contours (Weck is great). write jar mass on bottom

change starter jars about every 2 weeks to prevent mold. I actually have 2 jars that I use and toggle back and forth with each feeding so that I use a new, clean jar each time I feed the starter. my discard goes in a bigger jar in the fridge. You can add the discard to other goods you bake - pancakes, waffles, crackers, etc. Otherwise, you can throw away your discard from the fridge right as you take out the trash. Do not get any discard in your sink/garbage disposal.

Build a feeding routine (once or twice a day), and feed at peak or just before peak. Peak is when the starter has at least doubled in size. Your feedings train the starter to rise successfully and predictably when you bake bread. This is a very important factor to your bread's fermentation and taste.

sourdough feedings are given as a ratio of starter:flour:water

these days I've been feeding my starter at a ratio of 1:5:5, which, for me, is 5g starter, 25g flour (half bread flour & half whole wheat flour), and 25g water. I typically feed my starter twice a day when it is not in the fridge.

I always feed my starter 2-3 times before I need to make bread. So, if I want to get a dough going on Saturday, I will take my starter out of the fridge by Thursday to activate the starter with daily feedings.

## sourdough feeding example

For this example, we'll have a feeding ratio of 1:2:2

25g of starter, 50g of flour, 50g of water (room temp or cold)

1. put starter in a sanitized jar
2. add water to starter first, mix, then add flour and mix
3. place a kitchen towel or cover over jar and place the starter jar in a cool,dry place away from sunlight and heat sources (eg oven, stove, toaster, microwave)
4. when the starter has doubled or tripled in size, it is at its peak
5. another indicator that the starter is at peak, is when the top gets bubbly/bumpy

for the next feeding, we now have a starting mass of 125g of starer (25g of starter, 50g of flour, 50g of water from before)

6. remove 100g (this is your discard and can be saved in fridge to make other baked goods)
7. now we are back to 25g of starter. add 50g of flour and 50g of water
8. clean the lip of the jar to prevent mold and place kitchen towel over jar
9. place the starter in a cool, dry place away from sunlight and heat sources
10. continue this every day. if you forget a day, it's not a big deal, just keep going
11. if storing starter in fridge, feed 1:5:4, put on a loose lid, let rest for an hour, then refrigerate
12. if reactivating a refrigerated starter, let it sit out at room temp for an hour, feed at normal ratio of 2-3 feedings before using to bake bread
