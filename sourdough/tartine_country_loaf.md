# Tartine Country Bread

[original recipe by chad robertson](https://tartinebakery.com/stories/country-bread)

makes one loaf

I break this recipe into 3 sections. The first is making the leaven. The second is making the dough. The third is baking the bread. The boundary between each section is about 8-12 hours.

## making the leaven

1. put 0.5 tablespoons of starter (~10g) in a large jar (something that can hold about 3 cups or about 600 ml)
2. add 100g of water to starter and mix
3. add 100g of flour (50% whole wheat and 50% bread flour) to starter and mix
4. cover jar with kitchen towel and let rise in a cool place for about 8-12 hours

## making the dough

### prep

leaven is ready to use when it smells sweet in an overripe fruit sort of way. you want to catch the leaven at it's 'peak' or just a little before

get ingredients en place:

- 100g of leaven (the remaining leaven can replace your starter)
- 350g of water (cold or room temp but no more than 80F)
- 450g of bread flour
- 50g of whole wheat flour
- 10g of salt

### mix

1. add water to a large mixing bowl. add leaven and mix
2. add all the flour to the bowl and mix
3. let the dough rest for about 25-40 min (this is the autolyse)

4. after the autolyse, add 10g of salt and an additional 25g of water to the dough
5. squeeze dough between your fingers and then fold it on top of itself
6. cover bowl with towel

### bulk fermentation

bulk fermentation occurs when the dough is left to rise and ferment in bulk before shaping. be careful to not have your dough rise near a heat source, such as an oven or toaster

7. in the first 2 hours, every half hour, [stretch and fold the dough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwtTZK7_t08)
8. after hour 3, be gentle to not press gas out of dough. I usually do [coil folds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JQm2n4aVZc) after hour 3.
9. bulk fermentation is done when there are bubbles on top and around the ridges of where the dough meets the bowl. it usually finishes between hours 3-4 for me, but it depends on the room temp of where the dough was rising

### shape the loaf

10. pull dough out onto an unfloured surface (I put a sprinkle of water on the surface beforehand)
11. lightly` flour the top of the dough and work the dough into a round shape building tension
12. cover dough with a kitchen towel and let rest for 20-30m (bench rest)
13. make the [final shape of the dough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWA0RAAsBHg) and let rest for a minute

### cold ferment

the cold ferment will yield complex flavors in the bread. if you can't do it, dough can rise for 3-4 more hours before baking

14. make a 50/50 mix of rice flour and wheat flour
15. line a banneton (or loaf pan with clean kitchen towels) with rice/flour mix
16. place the dough in the banneton smooth side down with seam up
17. cover dough with towel and put in ziploc bag
18. put dough in the fridge for ~12 hours

## bake the loaf

1. about 20 min before you are ready to bake, place a dutch oven (both pot and lid) in the oven and preheat the oven to 500F
2. while the oven is preheating, gather oven mitts, rice/flour mix, lame(razor blade)
3. take out dough from fridge, dust the surface of the loaf (which is seam side up) with rice/flour mix
4. when oven reaches 500F, put on oven mitts, and carefully take out hot dutch oven
5. put dough in dutch oven, seam side down (should have the rice/flour mix on seam now)
6. score the dough (be careful not to burn yourself)
7. optional - spritz the dough with a spray bottle
8. put dutch oven in oven and cover with lid
9. turn down oven temp to 450F and bake for about 30 min
10. after 30 min, wearing oven mitts, take off lid
11. bake for another 20-25 min
12. carefully remove bread from oven
13. let bread rest and cool on a rack for 2-4 hours (it is still baking)
14. enjoy! bread is fresh for one day. slice and freeze bread for storage
