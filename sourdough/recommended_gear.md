# recommended gear

- scale
- a Weck jar (a 743 is great) for your leaven
- 1 or 2 tiny Weck jars for your starter (I also just use glass cups/mugs)
- 1 or 2 tea towels
- 2 sourdough starter jar covers with elastic band
- big metal bowl for the dough to rise in
- banneton
- lame or razor blade
- dutch oven
- bread knife
- thermometer
- wire cooling rack

## nice to haves, but not necessary (imo)

- bench scraper
- dough scraper
- food-safe spray bottle
- bread sling (I like [this one](https://rosehillsourdough.com/product/the-breadmat/?srsltid=AfmBOop5VgQt2yKuYIq3ZkEJdtUn0N2kEibFJPB1MgI5xUOax1J78lvF&v=0b3b97fa6688))
